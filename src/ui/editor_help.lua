-- Beginner copy for the graph editor tutorial.
-- Order follows the path a new user walks: what a graph is, how to move,
-- how to place a node, how wires work, then one concrete alert.
-- Later sections are the rest of the catalog. They start collapsed so the
-- first screen is the idea, not a wall of text.
--
-- Pin colors, gestures, and node names match the editor. A wire that the
-- engine would reject snaps back, so the copy says that instead of listing
-- every rejection code.
--
-- The client draws a newline as a missing-glyph box. A new paragraph is
-- another AddText, never a line break inside one string.
